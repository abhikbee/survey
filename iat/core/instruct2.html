<p style="text-align:center">You will be presented with a set of words or images to classify into groups. This task requires that you classify items as quickly as you can while making as few mistakes as possible. Going too slow or making too many mistakes will result in an uninterpretable score. The following is a list of category labels and the items that belong to each of those categories.</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%" class="categoryTable">
    <tr><th width="15%">Category</th><th>Items</th></tr>
    <tr><td id="clabel1"></td><td id="citems1"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabel2"></td><td id="citems2"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelA"></td><td id="citemsA"></td>
    <tr><td id="clabelB"></td><td id="citemsB"></td>
</table>


<h2>Keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two labels at the top will tell you which words or images go with each key.</li>
    <li>Keep your index fingers on the 'e' and 'i' keys to enable rapid response.</li>
    <li>Each word or image has a correct classification. Most of these are easy.</li>
    <li>The test gives no results if you go slow -- Please try to go as fast as possible.</li>
