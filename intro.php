    <p>In Part 1, you will be guided through a virtual Starbucks store to make a series of purchase decisions. Each time that you complete purchases, you will be rewarded with stars. After collecting a sufficient number of stars in Rewards Program A, you can select a free item of your choice. Then you will make a number of purchases under Rewards Program B until you collect enough stars to redeem a free item of your choice. Pay close attention to the stars received under the two programs as you will be asked to evaluate each program separately. </p>
<p>Part 1 takes about 8 minutes to complete. Again, thank you for participating. We really appreciate your valuable time and efforts in completing tasks for this research. </p>
